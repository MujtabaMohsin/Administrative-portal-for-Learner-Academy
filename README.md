## Core concepts used in the project.

•	Databases: used to store and retrieve data.

•	Data Sources: used to define a set of properties required to identify and access the database.

•	Collections: used some collections such arraylist to store collection of data. 

•	Exception Handling: used to catch problems that arises in the code especially in I/O blocks.

•	Cookies: to store log-in data on the client browser. 


## How to run the program
